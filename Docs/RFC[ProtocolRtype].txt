1. Introduction

   The protocol aims to enable the exchange of structured information between a server and a client quickly and securely.
   To achieve this goal, the protocol uses a defined data structure called TransferData, which encapsulates the commands and arguments needed to execute operations.

   1.1 structure TransferData

   struct TransferData
   {
    enum COMMAND command;
    std::array<int, 5> args;
   };

2. command sent by the server

   2.1 Player

      Element in transferData structure:
      - `transferData.command` = NEW_PLAYER
      - `transferData.args[0]` = ID Player
      - `transferData.args[1]` = Player X coordinate
      - `transferData.args[2]` = Player Y coordinate
      - `transferData.args[3]` = Type of the player

      This structure is sent to the client when a new player is created.

   2.2 Enemy

      Element in transferData structure:
      - `transferData.command` = NEW_ENEMY
      - `transferData.args[0]` = ID enemy
      - `transferData.args[1]` = Enemy X coordinate
      - `transferData.args[2]` = Enemy Y coordinate
      - `transferData.args[3]` = Type of the enemy

      This structure is sent to the client when a new enemy is created.


   2.3 Player Projectile

      Element in transferData structure:
      - `transferData.command` = NEW_PROJECTILE
      - `transferData.args[0]` = ID projectile
      - `transferData.args[1]` = Projectile X coordinate
      - `transferData.args[2]` = Projectile Y coordinate
      - `transferData.args[3]` = Type of the projectile

      This structure is sent to the client when a new projectile is created.

   2.4 entities position

      Element in transferData structure:
      - `transferData.command` = NEW_POS
      - `transferData.args[0]` = ID entity
      - `transferData.args[1]` = entity X coordinate
      - `transferData.args[2]` = entity Y coordinate

      This structure is sent to the client when an entity is moving.

3. command sent by the client

   3.1 Login

      Element in transferData structure:
      - `transferData.command` = LOGIN

      This structure is sent by the client when connecting to the server to create a player in the game.

   3.2 Input

      Element in transferData structure:
      - `transferData.command` = UP
      - `transferData.args[0]` = ID player

      this structure is sent by the client when the player move to the up side of the map.

      Element in transferData structure:
      - `transferData.command` = DOWN
      - `transferData.args[0]` = ID player

      this structure is sent by the client when the player move to the down side of the map.

      Element in transferData structure:
      - `transferData.command` = RIGHT
      - `transferData.args[0]` = ID player

      this structure is sent by the client when the player move to the right side of the map.

      Element in transferData structure:
      - `transferData.command` = LEFT
      - `transferData.args[0]` = ID player

      this structure is sent by the client when the player move to the left side of the map.

      Element in transferData structure:
      - `transferData.command` = SHOOT
      - `transferData.args[0]` = ID player

      this structure is sent by the client when the player shoot a projectile.

4. Error

   4.1 Empty

   Element in transferData structure:
      - `transferData.command` = EMPTY

   this structure is ignored because it is the base structure without any added commands or arguments

   4.2 Unknown

   Element in transferData structure:
      - `transferData.command` = Unknown
      - `transferData.args = arguments sent by the server or by the client

   This message is sent when the command and the argument is not known by the server and client side.
